## Plot

John woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally John would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

John feared The Zookeeper would find him but only ever hearing rumors about him decided to press onwards.

Being on time was not one of John’s specialties today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
John had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally John would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

John met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers. With these new powers John was able to quickly confirm that The Zookeeper does not exist. John kept these new powers a secret for the rest of his life.
The end.
